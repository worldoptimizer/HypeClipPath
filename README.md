Waiting for Tumult to implement it and my desire to rewrite the codebase one day led me to never upload this extension to GitHub. As interest in the extension grew, I uploaded it now to GitHub to benefit form version control. This way I can keep track and maintain bug fixes and offer a CDN. That's all folks! You can't expect more than that. There is no roadmap or future development planned for this repository.
