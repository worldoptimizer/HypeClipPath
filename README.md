This extension aims at offering clipPath support for vector shapes, as long as this isn't supported native.
As this is an old extension I always wanted to rewrite or was waiting to be implemented by Tumult, I never uploaded it to GitHub. As people are using it, and it is beneficial to people not needing to support ancient IE versions, I uploaded it to GitHub to keep track of the small bug fixes.
